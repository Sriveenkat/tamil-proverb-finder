# tamil-proverb-finder
Tamil Proverb Finder works with Python in Terminal (Basic Python Script)
This is a Tamil proverb finder. Entering a word in it will display the proverb that contain that word. It works best on Linux. 
If your Linux terminal doesn't display Tamil properly, download the [Konsole](https://konsole.kde.org/download.html) and view it. This finder tool created for adding Usage Examples in Wikidata Tamil Lexemes.
Note that **I don't know Python well**. You can develop this if you wish too.
